# 🏦 Dive Fintech

A Flutter-based fintech learning project built for Dive 2.5 students. This project focuses on exploring modern mobile banking UI, state management, and core Flutter development concepts while replicating designs from a professional Figma UI kit.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Dive Fintech is a practice project designed to help students understand how to:

- Build responsive fintech UIs in Flutter.
- Work with state management and data handling in mobile apps.
- Integrate mock data to simulate real banking functionality.
- Prepare for production-level fintech app architecture.

The UI is based on a professional FinPay banking app design, available on Figma.

## ✨ Features

- **Dashboard:** A beautiful and intuitive dashboard that displays the user's balance, recent transactions, and quick actions.
- **Transactions:** A detailed list of all transactions, with the ability to filter and search.
- **Cards:** A virtual card that can be used for online payments.
- **Profile:** A user profile screen with the ability to update personal information.

## 🎨 Figma Design

The UI for this project is based on the [iBank - Banking & E-Money Management App](https://www.figma.com/design/vS55XXa9vnpqpP5aVPe3kq/iBank---Banking---E-Money-Management-App-%7C-FinPay-%7C-Digital-%7C-Finance-Mobile-Banking-App-Ui-Kit--Community-?node-id=2-20347&p=f&t=KLgcex7001o3caMN-0) UI Kit on Figma.
